   "About" : "Model structure for the Katzin (2021 Chapter 4, also published as Katzin 2021a) greenhouse model without input weather data.",
   "Usage" : "This file can run as standalone, in which case no weather data will be loaded. Instead, constant values will be used for weather data. To run meaningful simulations, weather data can be acquired from EnergyPlus, see katzin_2021\\readme.txt, and scripts\\katzin_2021\\katzin_2021_create_formatted_weather.py. The simulation length is set to 1 day = 60x60x24 = 86400 seconds. Change this to 350 days = 60*60*24*350 = 30240000 to run a full tomato crop season. See scripts\\katzin_2021_run_sims.py for more examples",
