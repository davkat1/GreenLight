      "usage" : "In order to run a meaningful simulation, climate data must be provided. In this example, climate inputs are taken from an outdoor weather file, so the simulation is essentially of an outdoor crop. Weather data can be acquired from EnergyPlus, see vanthoor_2011\\readme.txt. Use the name of the generated weather file as the third line in processing_order, below. The simulation length is set to 120 days = 60x60x24x120 = 10368000 seconds (about 4 months).",
