      "About" : "This model is based on the greenhouse climate model described in Chapter 8 of Vanthoor (2011). Further description of the model is in Chapter 2 of Vanthoor (2011), also published as Vanthoor et al. (2011a).\r\n\r\nEquations for radiative transmission and reflection of multiple layers have been adjusted according to Katzin et al. (2020), to allow for easier model extension. See functions tau12, rho12Up, rho12Dn, under \"Lumped cover layers\", below.\r\n\rInitial values for the model states were chosen to represent 16.5°C, roughly 70% RH, and 390 ppm.",
      "Usage" : "This file follows Vanthoor 2011, Chapter 8 and therefore only models a greenhouse, and contains no definitions for the crop or greenhouse climate control. All values related to the crop and climate control has been set to zero, therefore simulations using this file alone represent a greenhouse with no crop, closed windows, and no active climate control.\r\n\r\nIn this file, input variables have been given as constants. In order to run meaningful simulations, a file with time-series input data is needed.\r\n\rFor an example on how to run this file with a crop model and weather inputs, see main_vanthoor_2011.json",
