This file ensures the climate is controlled to achieve constant values, defined by setpoints. Control is done with a smoothed proportional controller, following Katzin (2021a), which also appeared as Chapter 4 in Katzin (2021). Values chosen here for the setpoints are meant to serve here as an example.",
