      "usage" : "In order to run a meaningful simulation, climate data must be provided. In this example, climate inputs are taken from EnergyPlus, see vanthoor_2011\\readme.txt. Use the name of the generated weather file as the fourth line in processing_order, below. The simulation length is set to 350 days = 60x60x24x120 = 30240000 seconds",
