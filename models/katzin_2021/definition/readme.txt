Files for running the Katzin (2020, 2021, 2021a) greenhouse and tomato crop model in the greenlight platform.

In this folder:
    extension_greenhouse_katzin_2021_vanthoor_2011.json
        Extension of the Vanthoor (2011) model to create the Katzin (2021) model. The extension adds lamps, grow pipes,
        a blackout screen, and control settings. This file cannot be run on its own, it must be appended to the Vanthoor model,
        see main_katzin_2020.json and main_katzin_2021.json for examples
    main_katzin_2021.json
        Model setup that combines extension_greenhouse_katzin_2021_vanthoor_2011.json with the Vanthoor (2011) model to define a full greenhouse.
        This setup allows to run simulations as in Katzin (2021a).
    modification_katzin_2020_katzin_2021.json
        Modifications to extension_greenhouse_katzin_2021_vanthoor_2011.json that adjust it to recreate the settings for Katzin (2020).
        This file cannot be run on its own, it must be combined with other files, see main_katzin_2020.json
    main_katzin_2020.json
        Model setup that combines modification_katzin_2020_katzin_2021.json with extension_greenhouse_katzin_2021_vanthoor_2011.json
        to define the setup of the Katzin (2020) simulations.
    lamp_hps_katzin_2020.json
        Lamp definitions for HPS lamps as in Katzin (2020). Can be used together with main_katzin_2020.json to simulate a greenhouse with
        HPS lamps instead of LEDs. See scripts/katzin_2020/katzin_2020_run_sims.py for an example.
    lamp_hps_katzin_2021.json
        Lamp definitions for HPS lamps as in Katzin (2021a). Can be used together with main_katzin_2021.json to simulate a greenhouse with
        HPS lamps instead of LEDs. See scripts/katzin_2021/katzin_2021_run_sims.py for an example.

Usage:
    The following files can be provided as input arguments to greenlight:
    main_katzin_2020.json
        Run simulations as in Katzin (2020), emulating the experimental greenhouses of Wageningen University & Research in Bleiswijk, the Netherlands
    main_katzin_2021.json
        Run a greenhouse as in Katzin (2021) - a modern commercial greenhouse with LED lamps
    See scripts/katzin_2020/katzin_2020_run_sims.py and scripts/katzin_2021/katzin_2021_run_sims.py for examples
