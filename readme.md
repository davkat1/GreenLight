### Code used for [Katzin, Van Mourik, Kempkes, Van Henten](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.03.010) (2020, Biosystems Engineering)
The files `Code\runScenarios\evaluateClimateModelHps.m` and `Code\runScenarios\evaluateClimateModelLed.m` were used to evalute the climate model (**Table 3**, **Fig. 6**). 

The files `Code\runScenarios\evaluateEnergyUseHps.m` and `Code\runScenarios\evaluateEnergyUseLed.m` were used to evaluate the predicted energy use (**Table 3**, **Fig. 5**).

In order to replicate these figure, data recorded by Wageningen Greenhouse Horticulture was used. This data is under copyright and unfortunately could not be shared in this repository. More information about the data is available in:

- Dueck, T. A., Janse, J., Schapendonk, A. H. C. M., Kempkes, F., Eveleens, B., Scheffers, K., Pot, S., Trouwborst, G., Nederhoff, E., & Marcelis, L. (2010). [Lichtbenuttig van tomaat onder LED en SON-T belichting](https://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/wurpubs/401925).

The file `Code\postSimAnalysis\lampOutput.m` was used to analyze the energy outputs of the lamps (**Table 4**).

The version of the code used for this study is the one in [commit 8ba6eaa of GreenLight](https://github.com/davkat1/GreenLight/commit/8ba6eaad17c4cff4f3481e5f3ad87ad212140d6a) and [commit 0abbb7b of DyMoMa](https://github.com/davkat1/DyMoMa/commit/0abbb7b99db6e5922c4b61651e1a21403b4e1467).

## Using the model

Make sure you have all files in this repository, as well as those from the DyMoMa package, on your MATLAB path. 

### Example simulations

`runScenarios\exampleSimulation.m` shows how you may use a dataset of weather data (in this case, the Reference Year for Dutch Greenhouses), to run the model with default settings. The plot made here is of the lamp temperatures, but you may plot whatver model component you wish.

`runScenarios\exampleSimulation2.m` shows more uses of the model, now run with settings for a modern greenhouse, including plotting the outputs.

`runScenarios\exampleCropModel.m` gives a simple example of running only the crop component of the model.

### Scenario simulations as in [Katzin, Marcelis, Van Mourik](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.116019) (2021, Applied Energy)
- The file `Code\runScenarios\runWorldSimulations.m` provides an example of running the model in various climate settings and with various model parameters. A list of the model parameters is available in `Code\createGreenLightModel\setGlParams.m'.
- In order to analyze simulations output, the files available in the [associated dataset](https://doi.org/10.4121/13096403) can be used. This data can be explored further.

#### Example 1
In order to generate a figure as in Fig. 06, but with the "colder" setting instead of the "reference" setting, use `GreenLight\Code\postSimAnalysis\barEnergyUseWorldWide.m` but replace Line 15:

	outputFolder = strrep(currentFolder, '\GreenLight\Code\postSimAnalysis', ...
    '\GreenLight\Output\referenceSetting\');
	
with:

	outputFolder = strrep(currentFolder, '\GreenLight\Code\postSimAnalysis', ...
    '\GreenLight\Output\colder\');

#### Example 2
In order to generate a figure as in Fig. 11 for Beijing instead of Amsterdam, use file `GreenLight\Code\postSimAnalysis\plotWinterSummerDayTrajectory.m`, and replace lines 24-27:

	load([outputFolder 'ams_hps_referenceSetting.mat'],'gl');
	hps = gl;
	load([outputFolder 'ams_led_referenceSetting.mat'],'gl');
	led = gl;
	
with:

	load([outputFolder 'bei_hps_referenceSetting.mat'],'gl');
	hps = gl;
	load([outputFolder 'bei_led_referenceSetting.mat'],'gl');
	led = gl;
	
#### Example 3
In order to generate a figure as in Fig. 10 for different days in the growing season (e.g., December 1 and June 1), use file `GreenLight\Code\postSimAnalysis\barEnergyFluxes.m`. Modify lines 45-56:

	winterDay = 116;
	summerDay = 292;
	
To:

	winterDay = 65;
	summerDay = 248;

### Model evaluation as in [Katzin, Van Mourik, Kempkes, Van Henten 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2020.03.010) (Biosystems Engineering)
- Examples of an evaluation of the climate model are given in `Code\runScenarios\evaluateClimateModelHps.m` and `Code\runScenarios\evaluateClimateModelLed.m`.
- Examples of an evaluation of energy use are given in `Code\runScenarios\evaluateEnergyUseHps.m` and `Code\runScenarios\evaluateEnergyUseLed.m`.

In order to run these evaluation simulations, the data from the greenhouse trial is needed. This data is available at [Data from: ‘GreenLight - An open source model for greenhouses with supplemental lighting: Evaluation of heat requirements under LED and HPS lamps’](https://doi.org/10.4121/78968e1b-eaea-4f37-89f9-2b98ba3ed865). 

#### Instructions:
1. Download `Processed data.zip` from [Data from: ‘GreenLight - An open source model for greenhouses with supplemental lighting: Evaluation of heat requirements under LED and HPS lamps’](https://doi.org/10.4121/78968e1b-eaea-4f37-89f9-2b98ba3ed865).
2. Unzip the file and place its contents in `Code\inputs\Recorded greenhouse data from 2010 Bleiswijk trial`.
3. The evaluation scripts can now be run. Be sure that **lines 100 and 105** of `Code\inputs\loadGreenhouseData.m` point to the right location of the datasets.
